# Easy-Convert-Application

I decided to make an android application using the python kivy module to allow users to effortlessly convert different files to other filetypes. To use the program it requires you have kivy completely installed on your device as well as the other modules I used. Conversions happen within seconds and there will even be a notification prompted by Easy Convert to ley you know that your file is ready. Enjoy!

# How To Use The App

To use the app simply select one of the buttons based on what file you currently have and what filetype you want it to become. Upon selection you will be prompted to your file dialog box on your respective device. Choose the current file you have and if successful you will be prompted with a notice on the main screen. Revisit your file dialog box and your new file should be there ready to use. Notifications will also pop up just to confirm your new files availability.
